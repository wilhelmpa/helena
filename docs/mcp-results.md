# MCP tool results

Every MCP tool result contains an object in `structuredContent`. The existing text block
contains the original REST response body, including an empty string for HTTP 204. Existing
clients can continue reading that text.

A successful call returns:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "status": 200,
  "data": [{ "id": 12, "key": "ENG", "name": "Engineering" }]
}
```

`data` contains the JSON response, including arrays and primitive values. A non-JSON response
retains its text. HTTP 204 and empty responses without a declared string response use `null`.
Elysia sends numbers and booleans as plain text; a declared response schema lets the adapter
decode those values. A response schema allowing strings keeps non-JSON text as a string,
including values such as `"42"` or `"false"`.

A failed call sets `isError: true` and returns:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "status": 429,
  "error": {
    "code": "HTTP_429",
    "message": "Too many requests",
    "retryable": true,
    "retryAfterSeconds": 30
  }
}
```

- `status` is the REST HTTP status. Missing team arguments use 400; unknown tools use 404.
- `code` preserves a domain error code when the API supplies one. Otherwise it is `HTTP_`
  followed by the status number. Clients can branch on this code without parsing the message.
- `message` preserves the API's error message. Non-JSON failures use the HTTP status text
  or `HTTP <status>`.
- `details`, when present, contains additional fields from a JSON error response, such as
  validation information or conflict limits.
- `retryable` is true only for GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS calls returning 408, 429, 500, 502, 503,
  or 504. The adapter performs no retries. Mutations return false because a lost response
  can follow a completed write. Read the current state and reconcile it before repeating
  a mutation.
- `retryAfterSeconds` contains a valid `Retry-After` delay, including an HTTP date converted
  to a nonnegative number of seconds, or `null`. Other HTTP headers are never included.

Each tool advertises an `outputSchema` for this envelope. Declared REST success schemas
describe `data` for their corresponding HTTP statuses. The schema also permits the error
envelope, so SDK clients can validate failed calls. Undeclared statuses and unresolved or
runtime-only schemas use a permissive data schema. JSON Schema formats and runtime metadata
are omitted; the API remains responsible for validating its responses.

This uses the existing SDK's support for
[structured content and output schemas](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#structured-content).
It does not change protocol negotiation or the SDK version.
